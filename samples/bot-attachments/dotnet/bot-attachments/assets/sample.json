      "This sample demonstrates file attachment handling in Microsoft Teams using a bot built with the Teams SDK. When a user sends a file, the bot downloads it, stores it in memory, and sends a File Consent Card requesting permission to upload to OneDrive. Upon acceptance, the bot uploads the file and sends a File Info Card with a direct link. Declined requests are handled gracefully with a notification message."
